   <u> <h2 style = font-size:44px> What is Greek Mythology?</h2></u>
    <p> Greek literature and oral traditions are included in Greek mythology. It <br>
        explores their world's beginnings, the pantheon of gods that governed it, <br>
        and the complex network of legends that molded their way of life.<br>
        These stories give insights into the universe, human nature, and the <br>
        divine. They are a fascinating fusion of history, religion, and imagination.<br>
        Greek mythology has left an indelible mark on Western civilization. <br>
        Poets, playwrights, and artists have drawn inspiration from these tales <br>for centuries.

</p>
<br>
<br>
    <u><h2 style = font-size:44px>Types of Deties</h2></u>
    <p>There consist of different deties in Greek Mythology including the<br> immortals such as the gods (Olympians, Primordial deities, Titans), <br>
        spirits and giants and the mortals such as hereos, kings, Amazons and <br>
        creatures.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Olympians were the important gods that lived in at the top of <br>
        Mount Olympus:<br>
        <b>
        Aphrodite, Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Dionysus, Hades,<br> Hephaestus, Hera, Hermes, Hestia, Poseidon, Zeus.
    </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The primordial deities were considered the first beings that existed <br>and are what makes up the universe in this mythology. Primordial <br>deities themselves were considered to be from Chaos, or nothingness<br> from which everything came from. Unlike the Olympian deities, Primordial<br> deities are depicted as a place or realm:
        <b>
        <br>Aether, Ananke, Chaos, Chronos, Erebus, Eros, Gaia, Hermera,<br> Hypnos, Nesoi, Nyx, Uranus, Ourea, Phanes, Pontus, Tartarus, Thalassa,<br> Thanatos.
    </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Titans are older gods and known as the second generation within<br>
         Greek mythology:
         <br><b> Hyperion, Lapetus, Coeus, Crius, Kronos, Mnemosyne,<br> Oceanus, Phoebe, Rhea, Tethys, Theia, Themis
         </b>
        
    </p>
    
        <u><h2 style = font-size:44px>Mythology Influence</h2></u>
<p>
        Greek mythology has left an indelible mark on later civilizations and literature, <br>
        resonating across cultures and shaping the way societies engage with the <br>world. 
        Countless painters, sculptors, and architects have drawn inspiration <br>from Greek mythology. The majestic stories of the Olympian pantheon have <br>influenced the perspectives on beauty and art. For instance, the sculpture of<br> “The Discus Thrower” draws from the Greek god Discobolus. 
        There are many <br>influenced playwrights like Sophocles whom dramatized mythological tales <br>and created a deeper story from the folktlore.<br>
        <br>
        These ancient narratives<br> continue to demonstrate timeless relevance.
        Besides just the art influence,<br> there exist many ideals that were deprived from Greek tales. Allegorical<br> tales like Prometheus’s defiance and Sisyphus’s eternal struggle provide rich<br> material for existential contemplation and philosophical debate.
        The myth of <br>Oedipus also exemplifies the ideal of Fate vs. Free Will: the intricate interplay <br>between fate and free will and 
        the stories of Achilles and Odysseus introduce <br>the concept of tragic heroes that is seen repeatedly in media today.
